I have created a quiz app with random 5 questions.Whoever clones this repo can add more than 5 questions as the algorithm I have made will work.
So basically in this app what I have learned and added are the following things:
      1.  Additon of Images 
      2.  Creating a model with Classes and Lists(for questions)
      3.  Snackbar as you can see appears when you click on True or False
      4.  Raised Buttons
